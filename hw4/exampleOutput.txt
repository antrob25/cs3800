Roses are red, violets are blue,
I'm telling you I love you, so
is wonderful and new.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
Clinging vines are almost as bad as
If you only knew....... 

Roses are red, violets are blue,
I just want you to know that
is wonderful and new.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
I just want you to know that
he/she is using you.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
The center of my world
why continue to stew? 

Roses are red, violets are blue,
Use one of these poems
I need to be with you.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
The depth of my love?
I need to be with you.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
The center of my world
I think the world of you.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
We go together like
I need to be with you.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
You don't always smell good, but
as a love message from you

Roses are red, violets are blue,
You don't always smell good, but
I think the world of you.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
You will always be
is wonderful and new.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
You will always be
I think the world of you.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
We go together like
is wonderful and new.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
You will always be
super glue.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
You don't always smell good, but
my clothes match with my shoes. 

Roses are red, violets are blue,
I'm telling you I love you, so
as a love message from you

Roses are red, violets are blue,
Call it what you want to, but
what are you gonna do?

Roses are red, violets are blue,
The way that you kiss me
....Whew!

Roses are red, violets are blue,
It's you and me together
baby we're through.
