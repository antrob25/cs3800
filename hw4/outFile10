Roses are red, violets are blue,
What I feel in my heart
I need to be with you.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
We have nothing in common, so
begins and ends with you.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
I already said I was sorry, so
me and you.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
I'm seeing a future filled with
super glue.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
What I feel in my heart
is wonderful and new.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
The way that you kiss me
....Whew!

Roses are red, violets are blue,
I've never experienced
me hooked on you.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
We have nothing in common, so
a love so true.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
I just want you to know that
baby we're through.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
I'm seeing a future filled with
super glue.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
I'm seeing a future filled with
begins and ends with you.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
The center of my world
begins and ends with you.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
I'm telling you I love you, so
baby we're through.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
We go together like
as a love message from you

Roses are red, violets are blue,
The depth of my love?
a love so true.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
The center of my world
....Whew!

Roses are red, violets are blue,
We go together like
as a love message from you

Roses are red, violets are blue,
Call it what you want to, but
a lifetime of love, just for two.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
We have nothing in common, so
me hooked on you.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
You are stupid,
me and you.
