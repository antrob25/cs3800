Roses are red, violets are blue,
We go together like
I still love you.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
You will always be
If you only knew....... 

Roses are red, violets are blue,
I've never experienced
I need to be with you.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
The center of my world
is wonderful and new.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
The center of my world
begins and ends with you.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
I just want you to know that
I think the world of you.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
Call it what you want to, but
a lifetime of love, just for two.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
We go together like
as a love message from you

Roses are red, violets are blue,
I've never experienced
I need to be with you.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
The center of my world
a lifetime of love, just for two.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
Use one of these poems
as a love message from you

Roses are red, violets are blue,
I just want you to know that
as a love message from you

Roses are red, violets are blue,
I'm seeing a future filled with
If you only knew....... 

Roses are red, violets are blue,
It's you and me together
don't you think I've paid my dues?

Roses are red, violets are blue,
You don't always smell good, but
baby we're through.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
The way that you kiss me
why continue to stew? 

Roses are red, violets are blue,
The way that you kiss me
I still love you.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
The center of my world
....Whew!

Roses are red, violets are blue,
The depth of my love?
a love so true.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
I want to have sex now,
me and you.
