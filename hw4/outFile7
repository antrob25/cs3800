Roses are red, violets are blue,
The center of my world
as a love message from you

Roses are red, violets are blue,
The way that you kiss me
my clothes match with my shoes. 

Roses are red, violets are blue,
You will always be
what are you gonna do?

Roses are red, violets are blue,
We go together like
he/she is using you.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
What I feel in my heart
is wonderful and new.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
It's you and me together
a lifetime of love, just for two.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
The center of my world
....Whew!

Roses are red, violets are blue,
What I feel in my heart
me hooked on you.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
You will always be
me and you.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
Call it what you want to, but
If you only knew....... 

Roses are red, violets are blue,
I just want you to know that
begins and ends with you.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
Use one of these poems
begins and ends with you.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
You don't always smell good, but
I think the world of you.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
We have nothing in common, so
what are you gonna do?

Roses are red, violets are blue,
You have a great sense of humor that has
is wonderful and new.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
Call it what you want to, but
I think the world of you.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
I've never experienced
what are you gonna do?

Roses are red, violets are blue,
I'm telling you I love you, so
don't you think I've paid my dues?

Roses are red, violets are blue,
Call it what you want to, but
baby we're through.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
I'm telling you I love you, so
I need to be with you.
